<h1>About Me</h1>
<p >My name is Justin. I am a college graduate who currently lives in Franklin Square.
  I got a BS in computer science and am currently seeking a job. I like seeing birds 
  from time to time and would sometimes like to help the environment, too!</p>

<p>I am a graduate from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I have already 
  completed a course in data structures, principles of software, and computer 
  organization. From these courses alone, I have gained experience working in 
  the following programming languages:<ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>Haskell</li>
    <li>Prolog</li>
  </ul> </p>

<p>Coursework aside, I have also been in a few clubs, like the Game developer 
  club and the DDR club. I also have a few side projects I am working on like making a personal webpage and a video game. I learned even more programming langueges outside of 
  coursework, including the following languages:<ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>C#</li>
  </ul>
  I have also done some volunteer work, like:<ul>
  <li>Tutored some elementary school students in math</li>
  <li>Identified birds for a site known as eBird</li>
  </ul>
